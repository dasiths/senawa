# Redesign Implementation Log

This file records major implementation decisions, alternatives, deviations,
validation results, commits, pushes, and unresolved risks for the autonomous
Senawa alpha redesign.

The governing plan is [Comprehensive Alpha Implementation
Plan](research/07-comprehensive-implementation-plan.md). Product and architecture
research is indexed in [Redesign Research](research/README.md).

## Recording rules

Record an entry before or alongside implementation when a choice:

* Changes package or process boundaries
* Changes a public protocol, workflow, or storage contract
* Selects a third-party dependency
* Changes authority, durability, security, or failure semantics
* Deviates from the comprehensive plan
* Defers an acceptance criterion
* Changes phase order or scope
* Produces a failed validation that changes the implementation approach

Small local implementation details do not need entries unless they establish a
pattern that later phases will depend on.

Each phase records:

* Decisions and alternatives
* Deviations from plan
* Validation commands and results
* Independent review findings and resolution
* Commit identity and push result
* Remaining risks and next-phase constraints

## Decision D-001: Clean alpha implementation reset

* Date: 2026-08-12
* Status: Accepted by product owner
* Phase: 0
* Decision: Remove the current implementation and create a new minimal workspace
  in the existing repository. Preserve Git history, the devcontainer, WIP
  research, relevant probes, and generic tooling that remains useful.
* Alternatives: Refactor in place; maintain a parallel vNext implementation;
  delete everything except the devcontainer; create a sibling repository.
* Rationale: Senawa is alpha and has no compatibility obligation. In-place work
  would let current ontology and package seams shape the redesign. A parallel
  implementation would create an unnecessary legacy surface. A devcontainer-only
  wipe would discard evidence and history without adding design freedom.
* Consequence: Current apps, packages, schemas, persisted runs, commands, tests,
  examples, and compatibility adapters may be removed atomically.

## Decision D-002: Authority-oriented package graph

* Date: 2026-08-12
* Status: Accepted for implementation; may be revised by phase disproof
* Phase: 0
* Decision: Use protocol, kernel, runtime, storage, configuration,
  execution-host, supervisor, portal, reporting, and testing boundaries. Apps are
  composition roots only.
* Alternatives: Preserve current packages; one monolithic package; one package
  per process; domain/application adapter names matching the old system.
* Rationale: Boundaries follow authority and dependency direction. The pure
  kernel must remain isolated from storage and effects, while clients share one
  protocol without importing workflow behavior.
* Consequence: No new package may import legacy implementation code. Empty
  packages are not created before their first vertical slice.

## Decision D-003: Complete local alpha, remote protocol reference

* Date: 2026-08-12
* Status: Accepted scope boundary
* Phase: Plan-wide
* Decision: Deliver the complete local product and an authenticated remote
  protocol, outbound connector, deterministic control-plane simulator, and
  conformance suite. Do not claim a production hosted service.
* Alternatives: Build production multi-tenant hosting now; omit remote behavior;
  expose repository supervisors directly to the internet.
* Rationale: The protocol and partition semantics affect local architecture, but
  production identity operations, billing, regional deployment, and cloud
  storage are different products.
* Consequence: Remote completion criteria concern authority, delivery, replay,
  partitions, and data policy rather than cloud operations.

## Decision D-004: SQLite selection remains probe-gated

* Date: 2026-08-12
* Status: Open until Phase 4 probe
* Phase: 4
* Decision: Use a Senawa-owned embedded relational authority. Select the concrete
  SQLite binding only after no-credit packaging and durability comparison.
* Alternatives: `better-sqlite3`; `node:sqlite`; WASM SQLite; another embedded
  database.
* Rationale: The current Node floor and native packaging materially affect the
  distributable alpha. Choosing from convenience before probing would violate
  the migration plan.
* Consequence: Phase 0 does not add a database dependency. Phase 4 records the
  measured selection before implementation.

## Decision D-005: Commit and push each validated phase

* Date: 2026-08-12
* Status: Accepted by product owner
* Phase: Plan-wide
* Decision: Commit after the reset and after every implementation phase, then
  push `redesign/workflow-state-machine` to `origin`.
* Alternatives: One final commit; local commits with one final push; compatibility
  releases between phases.
* Rationale: Phase commits provide review, rollback, and recovery while the owner
  is away without requiring compatibility releases.
* Consequence: A phase cannot be marked complete before validation, independent
  review, log update, commit, and push attempt.

## Decision D-006: Heavy subagent delegation with central authority

* Date: 2026-08-12
* Status: Accepted execution strategy
* Phase: Plan-wide
* Decision: Delegate bounded research, implementation, and review tasks heavily,
  while the primary agent owns plan sequencing, integration, validation, commits,
  and this log.
* Alternatives: Primary-agent-only implementation; one subagent implementing the
  whole system.
* Rationale: Narrow agents reduce context decay, but central integration is
  required to preserve dependency and authority decisions.
* Consequence: Subagents receive exact phase scope and file ownership. Their
  reports are inputs, not phase-completion authority.

## Decision D-007: Generated artifacts remain outside Git

* Date: 2026-08-12
* Status: Accepted
* Phase: 0
* Decision: Ignore dependencies, package-manager caches, build output, coverage,
  TypeScript build metadata, local agent state, environment files, logs, and
  embedded-database files recursively. Preserve the existing root `.gitignore`
  rules and append only missing redesigned runtime and database patterns. Remove
  stale generated directories from deleted packages without deleting the active
  root dependency installation.
* Alternatives: Track built output; rely on package-local ignore files; clean
  the entire dependency installation before every commit.
* Rationale: Generated output is reproducible and creates misleading diffs. One
  root policy is easier to audit across future packages and apps.
* Consequence: Release packaging must build from source. Phase validation checks
  that generated files are ignored and absent from the index.

## Decision D-008: Retire legacy guides without breaking history links

* Date: 2026-08-12
* Status: Accepted
* Phase: 0
* Decision: Replace the seven Beads-era numbered guides with short retired
  compatibility pages that preserve historical decision anchors. The redesign
  research and comprehensive plan govern the reset until validated contracts are
  promoted into new authoritative guides.
* Alternatives: Keep the old guides as current; delete every path and break
  historical links; rewrite full authoritative guides before implementation.
* Rationale: The reset cannot claim two current architectures. Stable historical
  anchors retain archaeology without carrying old decisions into the redesign.
* Consequence: New authoritative guides are created only when implementation
  phases pass their evidence gates.

## Phase 0 log

### Plan

* Preserve WIP research, relevant probes, history, and generic tooling.
* Remove the current implementation and compatibility surfaces.
* Create protocol, kernel, testing, and minimal CLI scaffolding.
* Validate install, build, typecheck, lint, tests, boundaries, and docs.
* Obtain independent implementation review.
* Commit and push.

### Decisions

* D-007 establishes recursive generated-artifact hygiene.
* D-008 retires the conflicting current-design documentation.
* The reset creates only protocol, kernel, testing, and truthful CLI surfaces;
  future package directories wait for their first executable vertical slice.

### Deviations

* The specialized Implementation Validator had no filesystem access. A
  filesystem-capable Researcher Subagent performed two severity-graded reviews
  instead. This changes review tooling, not review independence or criteria.
* Initial shared TypeScript `rootDir` and Biome include patterns were corrected
  after focused validation exposed project-relative output and generated-file
  traversal defects.

### Validation

Passed on 2026-08-12:

* `pnpm install`
* Clean `pnpm build`
* `pnpm typecheck`
* `pnpm lint` across 22 intended source and configuration files
* `pnpm test`: 2 files and 5 tests, including built CLI subprocess behavior
* `pnpm check:boundaries`: 14 source files plus negative rule fixtures
* `pnpm docs:links`: 37 Markdown files
* `git diff --check`
* Git index scan: no tracked `node_modules`, `dist`, coverage, package cache,
  agent state, environment, build metadata, log, or database files
* Preserved probe tree restored byte-for-byte after an over-broad formatter run

### Review

Independent review found:

* High: Biome traversed generated output. Resolved with source-specific include
  patterns and a successful lint-after-build check.
* High: Replacement files were unstaged while deletions were staged. Resolution
  is the atomic `git add -A` and staged-diff review immediately before commit.
* High: Legacy numbered guides claimed Beads architecture was current. Resolved
  by retired compatibility pages and reset authority language.
* Medium: Boundary enforcement lacked negative coverage. Resolved with checks
  for kernel and protocol Node imports, app and testing imports, adapter imports,
  and runtime observations.
* Low: CLI help was not an exact allowlist. Resolved with exact renderer and
  built-process assertions plus package-version consistency.

No unresolved critical, high, medium, or low findings remain before staging.

### Commit and push

Pending atomic staging, staged-diff review, commit, and push.

### Remaining risks

* Preserved probes may reference deleted production packages. Each such probe
  must remain clearly historical or be adapted only when its subject is
  reimplemented.
* Root guidance and README must not describe deleted commands as available.
* The reset must be buildable in the same commit as the deletions.
